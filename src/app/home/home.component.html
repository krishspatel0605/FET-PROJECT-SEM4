        <h2>Welcome to the Fitness Data Tracking Application!</h2>
        <p>Our easy-to-use platform is designed to help you track your fitness progress and achieve your goals. With our comprehensive solution, you can easily record your fitness data using a standardised battery of tests that are prescribed on the platform.</p>
        <p>Our system automatically updates the data periodically and presents it in the form of a 'Fitness Index' that allows you to compare your progress with that of others in your region, district, age, and gender. This provides you with an accurate understanding of your fitness levels and helps you make informed decisions about your health.</p>
        <p>As part of the Sports, Youth & Cultural Activities Department, we offer a centralised repository of fitness data across the state. This means that coaches and sports administrators can easily identify potential talent and work towards improving fitness levels of their teams.</p>
        <p>Our platform also provides regular check-ins on healthy growth and development, allowing you to identify any early signs of health issues and work towards finding solutions to augment fitness levels.</p>
